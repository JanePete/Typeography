                    Institute of Chicago! Impressively, I stayed awake from 10 AM to 11 PM, scroll to view my day in

                    Hour 1 [ 10:16 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-1.jpg"
                    alt="Picture looking up at the above-ground train and skyscrapers">
                <figcaption> This photo is from a sunny Chicago morning on Thursday, March 1st. On the
                    way to breakfast, we stopped to admire the city's amazing arcitecture. </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 2 [ 11:07 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-2.jpg" alt="3 girls pictured on a bridge">
                <figcaption> Pictured from left to right is my twin sister Jenny, and my two roomates,
                    Dasha and Damla. Together, we explored Chicago. Jenny goes to school in the city and knew
                    all
                    the best spots! Here they are pictured in front of the lake that was just dyed green for St.
                    Patricks Day. <div class="a">They may look happy here, but we were all pretty hangry. They
                        are very good actresses.
                        Bravo.</div>
                </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 3 [ 12:32 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-3.jpg" alt="Selfie of two girls holding donuts">
                <figcaption> Breakfast time! At noon we stopped by Stan's Donuts, a local chain, to grab
                    donuts and coffee. I ate a pistachio donut-much better than expected !</figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 4 [ 1:26 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-4.jpg"
                    alt="Picture of a reflection of a group of girls in a crowd">
                <figcaption> A classic bean pic ! Although we were with a local, we had to do all the
                    cheesy tourist activities too ! Here is a pic of all of us in the reflection of The Bean, a
                    sculpture in Millenial Park. Fun fact: "The Bean" is just a nickname for the real sculpture
                    title,
                    "Cloud Gate" after the way it reflects the sky.</figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 5 [ 2:02 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-5.jpg"
                    alt="2 girls under a street sign titled 'Magnificent Mile'">
                <figcaption> In the afternoon we walked the Magnificant Mile and did some window
                    shopping. Because we couldn't bring any liquids on the plane, every morning we stopped by the
                    Macy's perfume counter and just
                    laid it on thick! The ladies working there started getting really annoyed by the end of the
                    week.</figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 6 [ 3:40 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-6.jpg"
                    alt="two girls on bicycles with city skyline in the back">
                <figcaption> Mid-day, we rented bicycles and rode by the Navy Pier which features a
                    beautiful view of the skyline and Lake Michigan. I tried to take pictures while riding my
                    bike and I literally fell off. There is also no railing between the sidewalk and Lake
                    Michigan ! A
                    very dangerous situation for uncoordinated people like myself.<div class="a"> The weather
                        this day was surprisingly warm! It was the first day since Autumn that the lake had been
                        defrosted. The water was so clear and bright which made it reflect the skyline
                        beautifully.</div>
                </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 7 [ 4:37 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-7.jpg"

                    alt="picture of a window with words written in it's dust">
                <figcaption> We took the pinkline on the above ground train to a neighboorhood called Pilson for some
                    thrift and vintage shoppping. In this photo, someone had wrote "old werld" in the dust on a
                    store window. I thought it was funny, thus, a picture was born.
                </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 9 [ 6:41 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-9.jpg" alt="picture of the corner of a library bookshelf">
                <figcaption> Nearby, we stopped into a bookstore. There were techinically no phones
                    allowed for some reason but I was feling rebellious so this is a snapshot I took of the
                    mystery
                    section ! </figcaption>


                <h3>Hour 10 [ 7: 10 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-10.jpg" alt="girl smiling outside of a bookshop window"

                <figcaption> Late dinner at Dough Bro's
                    pizza ! It was hard to find thin crust pizza in Chicago but finally we satisfied our
                    East Coast cravings ! </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 12 [ 9:00 ] </h3>
                <img src="img/Hour-12.jpg" alt="image of the James M. Netherlander Theatre stage">
                <figcaption>At the James M. Nederlander Theatre, we saw "A Bronx Tale"
                    the musical. Less well known but nevertheless a great soundtrack. </figcaption>


                <h3> Hour 13 [ 10:44 ] </h3> <img src="img/Hour-13.jpg"
                    alt="Image of the Chicago Riverwalk sign in front of two buildings">
                <figcaption> Torwards the end of the night, the weather got a lot colder and the sky a
                    lot foggier. This is a picture of the skyskrapers as we walked around at night.
                </figcaption>

                <figcaption> This is another image where I tried to capture the buildings fading into
                    the fog. A gloomy end to a sunny day. </figcaption>
